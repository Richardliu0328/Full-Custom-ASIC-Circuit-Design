Full-Custom VLSI Design of Multiplier-Divider System with Arbiter (Cadence Virtuoso):

Designed and implemented a high-performance 4-bit arithmetic system comprising a multiplier, divider, and arbiter using full-custom VLSI techniques in Cadence Virtuoso. The goal was to optimize for area, power, and delay (PAD), while demonstrating complete schematic-to-layout design flow, functional correctness, and post-layout verification.

Phase 1: Developed core digital building blocks including 1-bit Full/Half Adders, Subtractors, XOR/AND/NAND/INV gates, and designed a 4-bit Multiplier and Divider. Performed functional verification and delay measurements using testbenches.

Phase 2: Implemented a Mealy FSM-based Arbiter with round-robin logic and priority handling using 1-bit DFF. Verified integration with multiplier and divider and measured minimum clock period (~1.36 ns).

Phase 3: Completed full-custom layout of all modules including 8-bit DFF and 8-bit 2-to-1 MUX. Integrated system-level layout with buffer-based pipelining, followed by DRC, LVS, and post-layout functional verification. Achieved a PAD (Power × Area × Delay) score of 0.211 using 5 metal layers and also Top 20% of thee class.
